1. Company Income and Expenses
Instead of associating income and expenses with specific projects, you can treat them as general transactions. You can use the transactions table to track all types of income and expenses. For example:

Income: Record the company's general income in the transactions table with transaction_type = 'income' and the relevant category (e.g., "Company income").
Expenses: Record the company's expenses with transaction_type = 'expense' and a specific category (e.g., "Company expenses").

2. Withdrawals and Deposits (Per User)
Withdrawals and deposits are handled using the user_wallets table for each user's balance, and you can record these transactions in the transactions table as well.

Deposits: When a user deposits money into their wallet, the transaction_type is set to 'deposit'.
Withdrawals: When a user withdraws money from their wallet, the transaction_type is set to 'withdrawal'.

3. Project Profits and Losses
Project profits and losses can still be handled in the project_profit table. The profit can be recorded for each project, and the distribution of that profit can be tracked in the project_profit_distribution table.

To distribute profits equally among users:

You can calculate the total distributed profit by adding up the amounts in project_profit_distribution where status = 'paid'.

4. Equal Profit Distribution
In the project_profit_distribution table, you can distribute profits equally among users assigned to each project. Each user‚Äôs distribution is tracked, and you can query for their profits per project.

5. Company Profit/Loss Calculation
If you want to calculate the overall company profit or loss, you can:

Calculate the total income from the transactions table where transaction_type = 'income'.
Calculate the total expenses from the transactions table where transaction_type = 'expense'.

6. User Profits
User profits are tracked in the project_profit_distribution table, where you distribute the profits equally among project users. You can also track the total profit a user has received.

Workflow Example: Admin Panel
Create a Project:

Admin enters project details (e.g., name, description, start date).
Project is created in the projects table.
Assign Users to Project:

Admin selects users to assign to the project.
A record is inserted into the project_users table for each user.
Profit Distribution:

When the project generates profits, the admin calculates the total profit and equally distributes it among users by inserting records into the project_profit_distribution table.
Tracking Payment:

Admin can view the project_profit_distribution table to see which users have been paid and update the status field to 'paid' once the payment is completed.
